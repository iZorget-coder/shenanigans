i wanna give you some perspective.

imagine i take a piece of paper and i draw a 2D being. now say i give this being consciousness and free will, meaning they can perceive the world around them and act on it as they please. in their perception, i have created them from nothing. i have brought about the order and design from the chaos and disorder of this piece of paper. and since they have free will, they can choose to not believe my existence and that i created them.

now imagine i draw/create a box in front of them and in this box i draw an object, like a ball. since they are in a 2D world, all they can see is a straight line in front of them and this is because they don't have access to the 3rd dimension which would otherwise enable them to have the perspective which i have as the creator of his world. this also means my creation can never perceive me, a 3 dimensional being, they can never perceive the very pen i used to create them or how it works. that's something they can never fathom because their 2D consciousness is incapable. 

now, this world is made up of just ink and paper, in other words the ink is their matter and the paper is space. so in their world if they create scientific instruments to better understand the world around them, they would eventually conclude that their world is made up of the very small dots of ink that are arranged in a specific way to formulate reality, and this is mediated through a piece of paper. this means, scientifically, anything outside of this reality, doesn't exist. and that includes me, the pen i used, my consciousness, my image, my voice or sound. there's a whole world they will never know of and the only way for them to know i exist, is if i try to create a relationship with them.
