one thing they work hard to hide is the character of God, present and surrounding us in being—like the forces of nature, phenomena, basic science, and existence as a whole. they use tools to obscure the truth, to explain things, and to give perspective. this shift in perspective eliminates the evidence of the actual truth. there is power in possessing both truth and perspective. they hide this because they understand that how you perceive things influences your engagement with them, and your engagement influences things. a form of power. our perspectives are often shaped to channel this power towards things they deem meaningless, making us an unconscious utility. a great way to keep people busy, out of the way, and beneficial at the same time. inevitable success. you must remember that the enemy is present and prevalent and runs the world for we are not from here. on a course to self destruction.

it's like walking from point A to point B. you're only aware of the things you pay attention to while factually, there's a whole world around you that you aren't even aware of. so in your perception, things outside the 'reality' of your consciousness simply to you either don't exist or are irrelevant to your purpose. seen as obstacles. not perceiving them doesn't define the fact of their existence. does the chair behind you really exist when you're not looking at it? or does it only exist when you perceive it. obviously the answer is that it does exist. simply because its existence doesn't depend on your perception. much like in the real world. there are thousands of basic things occurring without you being aware. some of these things are more influential than others. a person who understands this and doesn't want you to be aware of reality will do everything to keep reality out of your perception. without you even being aware.
